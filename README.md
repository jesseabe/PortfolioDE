## Project 1 - Data Quality with Python and Pandera

**Goal**: Create an ETL with dataframe validation.

**Description**:
In this project, I utilized Pandera to enforce data quality during the ETL process. Pandera's validation framework ensured that the data loaded into the database adhered to the predefined data contracts. This involved setting up data schemas and applying rigorous checks to maintain data integrity, thus preventing errors and inconsistencies in the data pipeline.

**Key Features**:

- Implementation of data validation rules using Pandera.
- Automation of the ETL process with Python.
- Ensuring compliance with data contracts.
- Enhanced data integrity and reliability.

**Technologies Used**:

- Python
- Pandera
- Pandas
- SQL (for database operations)
